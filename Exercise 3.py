# The function accepts two numeric variables through the function parameters and divides the “numerator” by the “denominator”. The function’s main purpose is to prevent a ZeroDivisionError by checking if the “denominator” is 0. If it is 0, the function should return 0 instead of attempting the division. Otherwise all other numbers will be part of the division equation. Complete the body of the function so that the function completes its purpose.
